## Livelihood of the Rautes

Rautes migrate from one place to another, after the death of any member of the community. For living, they mastered the craft of wooden products, learned to hunt monkeys, and adapted to forest life. Monkey hunting is considered to be the fundamental side of protecting the cultural norms of hunting life of Rautes. They only hunt monkey; birds and other wild animals are never hunted by Raute members. Most often the male members get involved in making wooden products, hunting monkeys, trading their products in the market, and collecting food grains. Rautes exchange their wooden products for money, grains, clothes and goats. Women in Raute community are assigned the job of household, rearing their children, cooking food, collecting medicinal herbs, firewood and vegetables in the jungle. Rautes drink water from spring only, they do not drink water from ponds, hand pumps or wells. So, while they set their camps they prefer settlement near the source of spring water.
